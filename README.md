# Domain Switcher

~~This extension adds a page action menu to switch domains for Adobe AEM/CQ and other large projects.
Switch domain extension adds links to the page action menu. It uses simple regular expressions to enable you to match domains and replace sections of the URL. This extension was developed primarily for use when you are working on a large project with many servers, rather than many small projects. For smaller projects I recommend jmhobbs's Domain Swap extension https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/domain-swap/ngiiihlebepigjbefembddhdplmaghep~~
